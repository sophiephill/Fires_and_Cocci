# Fires_and_Cocci

This repo contains the code associated with the paper, *Association between wildfires and coccidioidomycosis incidence in California, 2000â€“2018: a synthetic control analysis*.

Human case data are protected health information (PHI) with access restricted to authorized California Department of Public Health (CDPH) staff. Case data is thus not included in this repository. For those seeking to conduct a similar multi-location study using distributed lag non-linear models (DLNMs), consider referencing the paper Multivariate meta-analysis for non-linear and other multi-parameter associations by Gasparrini, et al. in Stat Med, which contains both code and associated data.

The code is divided into five folders:

1. **Analysis** contains the code to analyze the effect estimates obtained from the generalized synthetic control analysis and covariate data. Within this folder, the R scripts are as follows:
* *Results Data* contains csv files for the effect estimates obtained from our analyses
* *CovariateITSAnalysis.R* contains the code for 
* getPercentChange.R
* GsynthControlSensitivityAnalysis.R
* InteractionAnalysis.R
* MesmaItsAnalysis.R
* MesmaPositiveControl.R
* PoolEffects.R

2. **Covariates**
* data 
* GetFireElevationData.R
* prism.R

3. **Hexagon Boundaries**
* Shape files for control grid and hexagonal boundaries surrounding fires. The main analysis used boundaries with radius 20km
* getHexagonalBoundary
* RmPostFireOverlaps

4. **gsynth**
* getCaseandCovdata.R
* gsynth.R
