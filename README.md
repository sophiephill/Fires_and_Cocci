# Fires_and_Cocci

This repo contains the code associated with the paper, *Association between wildfires and coccidioidomycosis incidence in California, 2000â€“2018: a synthetic control analysis*.

Human case data are protected health information (PHI) with access restricted to authorized California Department of Public Health (CDPH) staff. Case data is thus not included in this repository. For those seeking to conduct a similar multi-location study using distributed lag non-linear models (DLNMs), consider referencing the paper Multivariate meta-analysis for non-linear and other multi-parameter associations by Gasparrini, et al. in Stat Med, which contains both code and associated data.

The code is divided into five folders:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Counterfactual_Drought_Analysis contains the code to estimate the number of cases of coccidioidomycosis averted by or attributed to the 2007-2009 and the 2012-2015 droughts in California. Within this folder, the R scripts are as follows:
main_counterfactual_drought_script.R is the main script that performs the analysis, and calls the functions located in the second script.
	\begin{itemize}
	\item **counterfactual_drought_functions.R** 
	\end{itemize}
	
	\item 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item Blah
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}
